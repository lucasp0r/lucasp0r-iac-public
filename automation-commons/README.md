# What is the shell?
1. Text based interface to a computer that accepts text commands, does something with that command, and sends something to the screen (usually).  Geeky way to say this is [Read, Eval, Print, Loop - REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).
2. Other names: bash, shell, console, terminal, command line
3. Likely the lowest level interface most ever use to interact with the computer.
4. It is a non-graphical user interface.

# Why would you want to use shell?
1. Most direct (and sometimes only option) for working with a remote computer or cluster.
2. A GUI may not provide access to the full suite of capabilities of a program.  Example is git integration in RStudio.  It provides the basics and tools you use 90% of the time, but not to everything.  Need shell for that.
3. Truth is I don't always use shell, but I do use it.  It is part of the bag of tricks.
4. Anything that can be typed/scripted is more reproducible as the commands can be re-run.
5. Many powerful tools built in that allow for automation, working with large amounts of data/file, etc.
6. Lots of tools for working with text (which most data actually is at some level) 
7. Code-like...

# How do I start the shell?
1. Depends...
2. Different across OS
3. Usually can find icon to launch.  
  - On windows, look for git bash (it is installed with git)
  - In linux, look for terminal or x-term.  Also ctrl-alt-t usually does the trick.
  - On mac, Applications:Utilities:Terminal

# What are the key parts of the shell?
1. Prompt
2. Command line
3. Commands
  - usually three parts
  - command or program
  - flags or options
  - arguments
4. For example: ls -l ~
5. Tab completion

# Files and File Directories
1. File and directory structure
